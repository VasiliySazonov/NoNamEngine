### How to build?

Clone this repository.
You should have installed **glew**, **glfw**, **assimp**, **glm** libraries, **g++** compiller and **make** build system.
Then launch make from **engine** directory and it will build shared library in **bulid**.

### In which case should you use it?
---
The design philosophy of NoNamEngine is oriented toward simplicity.
And since it is still in the early stages of development.
This is a good choice only when you want to create something very simple.
